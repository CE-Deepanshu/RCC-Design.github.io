## üì¶ What You'll Find Inside

This repository covers essential design workflows for major RCC components, following IS code provisions and practical detailing standards:

### üß± [Beams](Beams.md)
- Design steps as per **IS 456:2000**
- Includes assumptions, bending moment, shear force, and reinforcement detailing

### üèõÔ∏è [Columns](Column.md)
- Axially and eccentrically loaded column design
- Based on **IS 456:2000** and **IS 875** for load combinations

### üî© [Slabs](Slabs.md)
- One-way and two-way slab design procedures
- Covers effective depth, reinforcement layout, and load considerations

### üß± [Footings](Footing.md)
- Isolated footing design
- Based on bearing capacity, load transfer, and IS code compliance

### üßó Staircases
- Design of dog-legged and open-well staircases
- Includes effective span, load calculation, reinforcement detailing

### üß± Retaining Walls
- Design of cantilever and counterfort retaining walls
- Covers earth pressure theory, stability checks, and reinforcement zones

### üíß Liquid Retaining Structures
- Design of water tanks, reservoirs, and sumps
- Based on **IS 3370** series for hydrostatic pressure and crack control
- Includes wall and base slab design with water-tight detailing
