# 🏗️ RCC Design Guide 

A structured repository dedicated to the design methodologies of **Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC)** structural elements, tailored for undergraduate civil engineering students.  
This guide emphasizes **manual design steps** based on **IS code provisions**, helping learners understand the logic behind structural design without relying on calculators or software tools.

## 📚 What You'll Find Inside

This repository covers the essential design workflows for the following RCC components:

- **Beams** – Design steps as per IS 456:2000 including assumptions, bending moment, shear, and reinforcement detailing.
- **Columns** – Axially loaded and eccentrically loaded column design procedures with reference to IS 456:2000 and IS 875.
- **Slabs** – One-way and two-way slab design steps, including effective depth, reinforcement, and load considerations.
- **Footings** – Isolated footing design based on bearing capacity, load transfer, and IS code compliance.

## 📖 Standards Referenced

- **IS 456:2000** – Code of practice for plain and reinforced concrete.
- **IS 875 (Part 1–5)** – Guidelines for structural loading: dead, live, wind, snow, and seismic.
- **IS 1893** – Criteria for earthquake-resistant design of structures.
- **IS 3370** – Design of water-retaining structures.
