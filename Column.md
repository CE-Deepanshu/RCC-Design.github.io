DESIGN OF COLUMNS

## Classification of Vertical Members in Structures

All vertical members may not be termed as **columns**.

- **Columns**:  
  *Only those vertical members whose effective length is more than three times the least lateral dimension are called columns.*

- **Pedestals**:  
  *Those vertical members whose effective length is less than three times the least lateral dimension are called pedestals.*
 
 **Comparison Between Short and Long Columns**

| S. No. | Item                        | Short Column | Long Column               |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 1      | Effective length of column  | ≤ 12         | > 12                      |
| 2      | Least lateral dimension     | —            | —                         |
| 3      | Tendency to buckle          | Less         | More                      |
| 4      | Strength                    | More         | Less than short column    |
