## üîç Comparison: Singly Reinforced vs Doubly Reinforced Beam

| Feature                          | Singly Reinforced Beam                                      | Doubly Reinforced Beam                                         |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reinforcement Location**       | Steel provided only in the **tension zone**                 | Steel provided in both **tension and compression zones**       |
| **Compression Zone Role**        | Compression handled by **concrete**                         | Compression handled by **concrete and compression steel**      |
| **Compression Steel Purpose**    | Acts as **dummy bars** to hold stirrups                     | Actively resists **compressive stresses**                      |
| **Moment Resistance Capacity**   | Designed to resist up to **Rbd¬≤**                           | Designed to resist **greater than Rbd¬≤**                       |
| **Usage Conditions**             | Used when section dimensions are sufficient for required moment | Used when section size is restricted or moment demand is high |
| **Structural Behavior**          | Limited rotation and deflection control                     | Enhanced rotation capacity and reduced long-term deflection    |
| **Seismic Suitability**          | Less flexible under seismic loads                           | More flexible and preferred in **earthquake-prone areas**      |
| **Economy**                      | Economical for basic applications                           | More economical for **complex or constrained designs**         |
