## ✅ Aspect Ratio (Definition & Formula)

The **aspect ratio (AR)** is calculated using:

**Aspect Ratio = Ly / Lx**

- **Ly** = Longer span of the slab  
- **Lx** = Shorter span of the slab

---

## ✅ Types of Slabs Based on Aspect Ratio

### 1. One-Way Slab

If **Ly / Lx ≥ 2**, the slab is classified as a **one-way slab**.  
- Load is carried **mainly in one direction**  
- Typically supported on **two opposite sides**

### 2. Two-Way Slab

If **Ly / Lx < 2**, the slab is classified as a **two-way slab**.  
- Load is distributed **in both directions**
